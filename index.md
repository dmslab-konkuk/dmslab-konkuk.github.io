## Introduction to DMS Research Group
The DMS research group is currently concentrating on research and development related to Smart Mobility Systems and Bio-Medical/Healthcare intelligent Services based on distributed system technology and deep learning-based artificial intelligence technology.
(DMS 연구그룹은 현재 분산시스템 기술과 딥러닝 기반 인공지능 기술을 기반으로 스마트 모빌리티 시스템 및 바이오 메디컬/헬스케어 지능 서비스 관련 연구개발에 집중하고 있다).

### Dstributed System Technology
By utilizing Cloud Platform Technology, which has been researched and developed for over 10 years, we are currently focusing on the development of “Intelligent Fog Computing (IFC)” technology, which is the core of the 4th Industrial Revolution and 5G technology. In particular, we are researching intelligent IoT gateway development suitable for “Intelligent Assistant for Silver” and “Digital Twin System for Urban Air Mobility” application fields, automatic construction of a safe, stable and scalable fog computing server system, and intelligent operation management technology.
(10년 이상 연구 개발한 클라우드 플랫폼 기술을 활용하여 현재 4차 산업혁명과 5G 기술의 핵심인 '지능형 포그 컴퓨팅(IFC)' 기술 개발에 주력하고 있습니다. 특히, "Intelligent Assistant for Silver" 및 "Digital Twin System for Urban Air Mobility" 응용 분야에 적합한 지능형 IoT 게이트웨이 개발, 안전하고 안정적이며 확장 가능한 포그 컴퓨팅 서버 시스템의 자동 구축 및 지능형 운영 관리 기술을 연구하고 있습니다).

### Artificial Intelligence Technology 
AlphaGo's core technologies, Deep Learning and Deep Reinforcement Learning, are being developed in the form of Distributed Multi-Agent System. In particular, we focus on distributed intelligent fields such as Distributed Multi-Agent Cooperative and Competitive Systems, Real-time Multi-Object Tracking Systems,  as well as natural language processing fields such as Question Answering, Question Generation, Auto Knowledge Construction, etc.
