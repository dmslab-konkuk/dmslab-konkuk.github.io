## [Edge/Fog Computing System Area](./EdgeFogSystem)
- Edge Computing is a distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the sources of data
- Fog Computing is an architecture that uses edge devices to carry out a substantial amount of computation, storage and communication locally and routed over the Internet backbone
- The DMS Edge/Fog System team is currently researching about
	- Autonomic Provisioning Edge Cluster System
	- Smart Gateway for onboarding IoT devices to Edge Cluster

## [Mobile Robot Navigation Area](./MobileRobotNavigationArea)
- Global Navigation
    - **Global Navigation** involves planning the optimal trajectory for mobile robots (both ground and aerial) to move from a starting point to a destination based on a given map.
    - In known environments, algorithms such as A*, Dijkstra, and RRT are used for path planning, while in unknown environments, **Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)** enables real-time map generation and updates.
    - Our research extends beyond **wheeled robots (e.g., TurtleBot)** to include **Aerial robots (e.g., drones)**, incorporating **3D SLAM and path optimization techniques** for aerial navigation.
- Local Navigation
    - **Local Navigation** ensures that an agent follows the planned trajectory while dynamically avoiding obstacles and adapting to real-time environmental changes.
    - Avoiding not only static obstacles but also **dynamic obstacles such as humans, vehicles, and drones** is a key challenge.
    - We leverage **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)** to enable robots to learn and make optimal navigation decisions in complex, dynamic environments.
    - MARL-based approaches allow multiple agents (both ground and aerial robots) to cooperate in real time, minimizing interference and optimizing collective movement strategies.
    - Our research focuses on both **wheeled mobile robots (TurtleBot, etc.)** and **aerial mobile robots (UAVs etc.)**, ensuring efficient and safe navigation in **3D environments with dynamic obstacles.**
- Digital Twin
    - **Digital Twin technology** creates realistic digital replicas of real-world robotic systems, providing a **high-fidelity simulation platform** for testing and optimizing algorithms before real-world deployment.
    - Using **Unreal Engine**, we develop high-resolution simulation environments, allowing us to train and validate reinforcement learning-based navigation models efficiently.
    - Our research includes building **Digital Twins for both UAVs and ground robots**, enabling predeployment training and validation of reinforcement learning models in diverse scenarios.
    - We specifically focus on **Multi-Agent Digital Twin Simulations**, where multiple mobile robots operate in a shared virtual space, enabling collaborative navigation, obstacle avoidance, and optimal coordination strategies.

## [Digital Twin Area](./DigitalTwin.md)

- Digital twin (DT) is a pioneering technology and a promising game-changer in various emerging industries. 
- The concept of DT opens a world of possibilities for fundamentally the infusion of physical-twin specific computational models which are dynamically updated into a feedback loop of data-driven analysis and decision-making. 
- A digital twin is a set of coupled computational models that gradually transit throughout different states in its featured state-space as time goes on, in which constantly and equivalently represent the real-world structure, behaviors and surrounding context of its physical twin.
- DMS Group is working on the development of (i) neural digital twin dynamic engines (DTDE), (ii) neural digital twin control engines (DTCE), (iii) digital twin control frame (DTCF) and (iv) digital twin cloud infrastructure (DTCI) for U*V systems.

## [Dependability and Security Quantification Area](./DependabilitySecurity.md)

- Dependability and security are of five distinctive natures (along with functionality, performance, and cost) for computing and communication systems.
- Computing systems and networks with a sophisticated composition of multi-level systems and things are inevitably prone to a chain of threats (faults, errors, and failures) which eventually causes fatal losses, such as service interruption/outage, data leak, or even human lives.
- Even a 1% failure rate is too high, because it causes 3.65 days of unscheduled downtime in a year which, in turn, may reduce an enormous amount of enterprise turnover.
- Therefore, dependability and security requirements should be taken into consideration to obtain the highest level of trustworthiness for computing infrastructures, in practice.
- DMS Group is working on the quantification methodologies for dependability and security metrics of computing systems and networks: virtualized server systems (VSS), data center networks (DCN), software defined network (SDN), Cloud-Fog-Edge Continuum (CFE), Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), Internet of Industrial Things (IoIT), unmanned aerial systems (UAS) etc.
