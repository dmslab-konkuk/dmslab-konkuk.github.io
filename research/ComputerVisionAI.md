- Summary:Emotion recognition is an important research topic in the field of computer vision, and is the primary problem in affective computing, as well as the focus and difficulty of research. It would have a better impact on our lives if we could use inexpensive machines to monitor and understand the emotional information of others. However, there is currently no system that can do such a job. Because human emotional states are expressed in various ways, such as speech, expressions, actions, the environment in which a person is living, and various physiological signals, it is difficult to accurately reflect human emotions by relying on a single characteristic parameter and its features. We propose a framework, Muti-task Emotion Recognition (MTER), with four main models: face feature extraction model, body feature extraction model and context (scene) feature extraction model, and then fusion classification model. It is used to analyze images containing multiple people and recognize fused emotions based on face facial features, body features, and contextual information. The face feature and body feature extraction module takes the face and body parts of the image as input and the information implicit in the image such as facial expression, head position and body pose is extracted. In order to make the emotion recognition actively applied to real life, Fine-tuned Mobilenet lightweight network is utilized to reduce the computational effort and increase the recognition speed.

- Activity recognition in video or picture files uses the attention mechanism to recognize more efficiently and quickly. At the same time, multiple activity recognition in a single video file, and related papers such as multi-modal recognition methods are also under investigation.
